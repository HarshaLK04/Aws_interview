# Build stage
FROM node:14-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Final stage
FROM nginx:1.21-alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]



#   In this example, the first stage builds a Node.js application and generates a production build using "npm run build."
#   The second stage uses the Nginx base image and copies the build artifacts from the first stage using the "COPY --from=build" command.
#   Finally, it exposes port 80 and starts the Nginx server.
