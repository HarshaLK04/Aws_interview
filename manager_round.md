`Technical knowledge`: The manager may ask questions related to the candidate's knowledge of various DevOps tools and technologies, such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) tools, infrastructure as code (IAC) tools, and monitoring tools. They may also ask about the candidate's experience with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

`Problem-solving skills`: The manager may present the candidate with hypothetical scenarios or problems and ask how they would approach and solve them. This could include troubleshooting a production issue or implementing a new CI/CD pipeline.

`Collaboration and communication:` The manager may ask the candidate about their experience working in a team and how they communicate with team members. They may also ask how they prioritize tasks and manage their workload.

`Process improvement:` The manager may ask the candidate about their experience with process improvement, such as how they identify areas for improvement, implement changes, and measure the success of those changes.

Business acumen: The manager may ask the candidate about their understanding of the business and how their work as a DevOps engineer impacts the organization's goals and objectives.

1. `What is your role in a team?`
e.g I am equally comfortable taking the lead or allowing a coworker to delegate tasks to me.
 In my previous experiences, I have managed projects as a team lead and also worked under the direction of other team leads.
  My experience working with a diverse group of people with unique skills and abilities has allowed me to understand that 
  I may require to shift and adjust my role according to the project

2.`If you make a mistake, how do you fix it?`
  When I make a mistake, I immediately communicate it and create a plan to rectify it.
  In my first role as a software developer, I realised that the code I wrote would lead to some bugs down the line. 
 In this situation, I communicated my mistake and resolved it immediately.

3. What are your long-term career goals?
I have significant experience with software development, but I would now like to take on managerial responsibilities.
 I want to become a leader with several teams working on different projects simultaneously. 
Considering the number of projects your organisation runs, I believe I can work towards that aspiration

2. Explain your understanding and expertise on both the software development side and the technical operations side of an organization you’ve worked for in the past.
DevOps engineers almost always work in a 24/7 business critical online environment. 
I was adaptable to on-call duties and able to take up real-time, live-system responsibility.
 I successfully automated processes to support continuous software deployments. 
 I have experience with public/private clouds, tools like Chef or Puppet, scripting and automation with tools like Python and PHP, and a background in Agile.

 `Give me an example of how you would handle projects?`
 As a professional with managerial responsibilities, I would demonstrate a clear understanding of DevOps project management tactics and also work with teams to set objectives, streamline workflow, maintain scope, research and introduce new tools or frameworks, translate requirements into workflow and follow up. I would resort to CI, release management and other tools to keep interdisciplinary projects on track.
 
 6. What’s your career objective in your role as a DevOps engineer?
 My passion is breaking down the barriers and building and improving processes, so that the engineering and operations teams work better and smarter. That’s why I love DevOps. It’s an opportunity to be involved in the entire delivery system from start to finish.
 
 7. How would you make software deployable?
 The ability to script the installation and reconfiguration of software systems is essential towards controlled and automated change. Although there is an increasing trend for new software to enable this, older systems and products suffer from the assumption that changes would be infrequent and minor, and so make automated changes difficult. As a professional who appreciates the need to expose configuration and settings in a manner accessible to automation, I will work with concepts like Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection, scripted installation, test harnesses, separation of concerns, command-line tools, and infrastructure as code.
 
 8.`What is the one most important thing DevOps helps do?`
 The most important thing DevOps helps do is to get the changes into production as quickly as possible while minimizing risks in software quality assurance and compliance. That is the primary objective of DevOps. However, there are many other positive sideeffects to
 DevOps. For example, clearer communication and better working relationships between teams which creates a less stressful working environment.
 
 9. Which scripting languages do you think are most important for a DevOps engineer?
 As far as scripting languages go, the simpler the better. In fact, the language itself isn’t as important as understanding design patterns and development paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, or functional programming.


 19. What’s your systems background?
Tips to answer: Some DevOps jobs require extensive systems knowledge, including server clustering and highly concurrent systems. As a DevOps engineer, you need to analyze system capabilities and implement upgrades for efficiency, scalability and stability, or resilience. It is recommended that you have a solid knowledge of OSes and supporting technologies, like network security, virtual private networks and proxy server configuration.
DevOps relies on virtualization for rapid workload provisioning and allocating compute resources to new VMs to support the next rollout, so it is useful to have in-depth knowledge around popular hypervisors. This should ideally include backup, migration and lifecycle management tactics to protect, optimize and eventually recover computing resources. Some environments may emphasize microservices software development tailored for virtual containers. Operations expertise must include extensive knowledge of systems management tools like Microsoft System Center, Puppet, Nagios and Chef. DevOps jobs with an emphasis on operations require detailed problem-solving, troubleshooting and analytical skills.


20.` What DevOp tools have you worked with?`
Tips to answer: Software configuration management and build/release (version control) tools, including Apache Subversion, Mercurial, Fossil and others, help document change requests. Developers can more easily follow the company’s best practices and policies while software changes.
Continuous integration (CI) tools such as Rational Build Forge, Jenkins and Semaphore merge all developer copies of the working code into a central version. These tools are
important for larger groups where teams of developers work on the same codebase simultaneously. QA experts use code analyzers to test software for bugs, security and performance. If you’ve used HP’s Fortify Static Code Analyzer, talk about how it identified security vulnerabilities in coding languages. Also speak about tools like GrammaTech’s CodeSonar that you used to identify memory leaks, buffer underruns and other defects for C/C++ and Java code. It is essential that you have adequate command of the principal languages like Ruby, C#, .NET, Perl, Python, Java, PHP, Windows PowerShell, and are comfortable with the associated OS environments Windows, Linux and Unix.


27. `What was your greatest achievement on a recent project?`
Tips to answer: Make sure you demonstrate your perfect understanding of both development and operations. Do not let your answer lean towards one particular skillset ignoring the other. Even if you have worked in an environment wherein you had to work more with one skillset, assure the intervewer that you are agile according to the needs of your organization.

28. What problems did you face and how did you solve them in a way that met the team’s goals?
Tips to answer: This questions aims to find out how much you can handle stress and nonconformity at work. Talk about your leadership skills to handle and motivate the team to solve problems together.Talk about CI, release management and other tools to keep interdisciplinary projects on track.

29. Are you more Dev or Ops?
Tips to answer: This is probably the trickiest question that you might face in the interview. Emphasize the fact that this depends a lot on the job, the company you are working for and the skills of people involved. You really have to be able to alternate between both sides of the fence at any given time. Talk about your experience and demonstrate how you are agile with both.
