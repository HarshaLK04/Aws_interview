1. How is Kubernetes different from Docker Swarm?
		--
		Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are both container orchestration platforms, but there are some key differences between them:
		a. Architecture: Kubernetes is based on a master-slave architecture, where the master manages the cluster state and the slaves (or nodes) run the containers. On the other hand, Docker Swarm uses a manager-worker architecture, where the manager node distributes tasks to worker nodes.
		b. Scalability: Both platforms are designed to scale containerized applications, but Kubernetes has more advanced scaling capabilities, including auto-scaling based on CPU usage or custom metrics. Docker Swarm also supports scaling but is not as flexible as Kubernetes.
		c. Portability: Kubernetes is more portable than Docker Swarm, as it supports multiple container runtimes, including Docker, rkt, and CRI-O. This means you can easily move your applications between cloud providers or on-premises environments. Docker Swarm, on the other hand, only supports the Docker runtime.
		d. Community: Kubernetes has a larger and more active community than Docker Swarm, which means that there are more resources, tools, and integrations available for Kubernetes.
		e. Complexity: Kubernetes is generally considered to be more complex than Docker Swarm, as it has a steeper learning curve and requires more configuration. Docker Swarm is simpler and more straightforward, which makes it a good choice for smaller deployments or teams with less experience in container orchestration.
		Overall, both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are powerful container orchestration platforms, and the choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements. If you need advanced scalability, portability, or a larger community, then Kubernetes may be the better choice. If you need a simpler solution or are already using Docker, then Docker Swarm may be a better fit.




2. What is Kubernetes?
	Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google, but is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
	Kubernetes provides a framework for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications and services across a cluster of machines. It automates many common tasks associated with deploying and managing containerized applications, such as scaling applications, managing container lifecycles, and distributing network traffic.
	Kubernetes also provides a rich set of APIs that enable developers to build custom integrations and extensions, making it highly extensible. It has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, and is widely used in production environments across industries.
