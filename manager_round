1. What is your role in a team?
e.g I am equally comfortable taking the lead or allowing a coworker to delegate tasks to me.
 In my previous experiences, I have managed projects as a team lead and also worked under the direction of other team leads.

  I may require to shift and adjust my role according to the project

2.If you make a mistake, how do you fix it?
  When I make a mistake, I immediately communicate it and create a plan to rectify it.
  In my first role as a software developer, I realised that the code I wrote would lead to some bugs down the line. 
 In this situation, I communicated my mistake and resolved it immediately.

3. What are your long-term career goals?
I have significant experience with software development, but I would now like to take on managerial responsibilities.
 I want to become a leader with several teams working on different projects simultaneously. 
Considering the number of projects your organisation runs, I believe I can work towards that aspiration
